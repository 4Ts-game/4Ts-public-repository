Technique,JIGSAW - PHASE I (EXPERT GROUPS),"In Phase I of a Jigsaw, the teacher presents the general topic and then splits the learners into groups (so called Expert Groups), each of which corresponds to a specific sub-topic. 
For example, if the topic is World War 1, the groups might respectively be devoted to the causes (G1), the main events (G2), the resolution of the conflict (G3) and its consequences (G4). Each group is expected to study selected materials concerning their sub-topic, prepare a presentation and give a talk to the other groups.","All students will play, at least once, the role of ""experts"", this strengthens their self-efficacy.
The strong interdependence of team members and the change in teams configuration between Phase I and II foster creation of new social bonds, but when students are new to the classroom they might need to consolidate social bonds, rather than increase their number.",22,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,JIGSAW - PHASE II (JIGSAW GROUPS),"In Phase II of a Jigsaw, the Phase I groups (Expert Groups) are split up and reformed into new groups, each comprising at least one member from each of Expert Groups. Each of the new groups (called Jigsaw Groups) must write a text on the general topic and then present it to the others in a plenary session.",,37,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PYRAMID (FOR LIST PREPARATION) - PHASE I,"In Phase I of a Pyramid, the teacher presents a topic and provides individual learners with material for them to study and then asks them, individually or in pairs, to generate a list of items. These could be, for example, questions that should be asked in an interview with an expert, or the most important aspects of a given topic. ","It favours a gradual appropriation of the knowledge and encourages individuals to defend their own opinions.
The change in teams configuration does not help consolidation of social bonds but the effect is mitigated by the incremental way groups are aggregated.
",23,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PYRAMID (FOR LIST PREPARATION) - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Pyramid, the previous Teams are merged (individuals will form pairs, pairs will form teams of four) and each team will generate a new list satisfying each member. The aim is to reach agreement drawing on the results of the first phase. ",,43,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PYRAMID (FOR LIST PREPARATION) - PHASE III,"Phase III of a Pyramid entails a plenary session in which the various lists produced in the previous phase are presented and discussed, with the aim of generating a single, shared version that satisfies all.",,44,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PYRAMID (FOR PROBLEM SOLVING) - PHASE I,"In Phase I of a Pyramid, the teacher presents a topic and provides individual learners with material for them to study. He then asks them to work out a solution to a given problem individually or in pairs. ","It favours a gradual appropriation of the knowledge and encourages individuals to defend their own opinions.
The change in teams configuration does not help consolidation of social bonds but the effect is mitigated by the incremental way groups are aggregated.

Technique,PYRAMID (FOR PROBLEM SOLVING) - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Pyramid, the previous Teams are merged (individuals will form pairs, pairs will form teams of four) and each of the new teams will work out a new solution satisfying each member. The aim is to reach agreement drawing on the results of the first phase. ",,46,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PYRAMID (FOR PROBLEM SOLVING) - PHASE III,"Phase III of a Pyramid entails a plenary session in which a new shared solution is generated, based on the previous ones.  ",,47,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PEER REVIEW - PHASE I,"In Phase I of a Peer Review, the teacher presents the topic and asks the learners to study selected study materials. Then, the learners, individually or placed in pairs or small groups, are asked by the teacher to produce an artefact on the studied topic.","In Phase II, teachers should make sure that reviewers play the critical friend, not the assessor. Thus, better avoiding peer grading and encourage constructive feedback. The teams stay the same thoughout the technique, which helps consolidating the relationships between members. When the feedback concerns group work rather than individual work, the effect is less frustrating. ",38,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PEER REVIEW - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Peer Review, each learner or pair or small group comments on the artefacts that their peers have produced in Phase I, by providing suggestions on how the artefact might be improved. The group size is the same as in the previous phase. Regarding the 'direction' of feedback, it may be provided reciprocally (A gives feedback to B, and B to A) or in a circle (A to B, B to C, C to A).",,39,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,PEER REVIEW - PHASE III,"In Phase III of a Peer Review, the learners (in the same teams as in Phase I) produce a new version of their original artifact based on the feedback. At the conclusion, they present their work to the others in a plenary session.",,40,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,CASE STUDY - PHASE I,"In Phase I of a Case Study, the teacher presents a topic - typically a problem - and provides learners with material for them to study. Then the learners, in pairs or small groups, are asked to solve that problem.   ","In Phase I, students can help each other in finding a solution to the problem. 
In Phase II, they all see their peers solutions and learn by appreciating the differences. This comparison helps generate an indirect feedback, less frustrating and sometimes more effective than direct feedback.
",41,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,CASE STUDY - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Case Study, the learners individually examine the different solutions and then hold a plenary discussion intended to spotlight the pros and cons of each solution.  ",,42,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,DISCUSSION - PHASE I (ALL CASES),"In Phase I of a Discussion, the teacher presents a topic and asks learners to gather information from the web, which will then be debated in a plenary session. ","In Phase I information can be gathered from sources of different types (text/audio/video) and different languages thus facilitating non-native speakers, and in Phase II the production of graphical or tangible artifacts can mitigate the linguistic problems. ",48,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,DISCUSSION (TOWARDS ASSIGNMENT) - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Discussion, the students draw on the information that’s been gathered and carry out an assignment working individually, in pairs or in small groups.",,49,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,DISCUSSION (TOWARDS ARTEFACT) - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Discussion, the students draw on the information that’s been gathered and produce an artefact working individually, in pairs or in small groups.",,50,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,DISCUSSION (TOWARDS TEXT) - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Discussion, the students draw on the information that’s been gathered and write a text working individually, in pairs or in small groups.",,51,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,ROLE PLAY - PHASE I,"In Phase I of a Role Play, the teacher outlines a problematic situation and suggests a set of roles (or viewpoints) that can be taken to deal with that situation. The learners are then split into groups and group members assume roles. Then, the learners are asked to study some selected material. ","The different roles help students to relieve the students from the fear of expressing their own opinions.
Putting students in the shoes of others is a good way to make them experience the problems and the point of view of their peers, thus favouring inclusion. Hence, teachers shall encourage students in assuming unfamiliar roles.",52,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,ROLE PLAY - PHASE II,"In Phase II of a Role Play, group members (as in phase I) work together to deal with the situation and prepare a presentation. In doing so, each of the group members plays the role chosen in Phase I, voicing the viewpoint of that role to negotiate the presentation content. At the conclusion, the groups present their work in a plenary session. ",,53,,,,,,,,,,
Technique,,,,36,162,,,,,,,,,
Team,INDIVIDUAL LEARNERS,"Individuals working separately. Many tasks - like ""Writing a text"", ""Preparing a list"", ""Commenting on someone else’s work"" - can easily be performed either individually or in group. Some, such as ""Studying"", actually lend themselves best to individual work. Individual tasks are generally faster to complete than group work, as there is no negotiation involved. On the other hand, peer interaction can generate a rich learning experience and multiple contributions can significantly improve the final outcome.","Although individual work does not favour socialization and inclusion, sometimes it is necessary to have students study or work autonomously, possibly with tasks and technologies tailored to individual needs. ",24,25,26,27,,,,,,,
Team,SMALL GROUPS,"Groups of learners numbering three to eight people. Small groups are very well suited to tasks like ""Producing an artifact"", ""Preparing a presentation"" and ""Commenting on someone else’s work"", where considering multiple viewpoints can benefit both the learning process and the quality of the final outcome. On the other hand, the need for negotiation means that a task performed by small groups generally takes longer to complete than when it’s tackled by learners individually.","Small groups are ideal to favour socialisation among students, because they get to know each other quite closely. Groups can be formed by the teachers or by the students themselves. If the teacher forms the groups, he/she can use them to alleviate some problems (e.g. teams internally diverse in terms of abilities, gender, linguistic command, or to make sure that members can help each other in several ways). If the students are free to form the teams, the teacher should make sure that they do not form cliques or systematically avoid some of their peers. ",54,55,56,57,,,,,,,
Team,PAIRS,"Learners working in twos. Pair work is a good option when seeking to gain the benefits from learner interaction without sacrificing process efficiency. Pairs are suitable for tasks like ""Writing a text"", ""Preparing a presentation"" and ""Commenting on someone else’s work"". Negotiation in pairs can be fairly rapid, but the ultimate success of pair work depends on a balanced  contribution from both partners. Problems arise if one of the two does not contribute sufficiently to the task. ","Working in pairs puts a strong responsibility on each student. Teachers should be aware that some students tend to be rather assertive and shy away shameful ones. Pairs work better if members have complementary and well balanced skills. In case of learners who are beginners in local language, they should be (possibly) teamed up with someone who speaks their native language. ",58,59,60,61,,,,,,,
Team,MEDIUM-SIZED GROUPS,"Groups of learners numbering nine to nineteen people. Medium-sized groups are usually best suited to phases of work like familiarization or meta-reflection that require interactions but do not necessarily entail generation of a final product. The relatively high number of members in medium-sized groups means that the level of interdependence among the group members is low, and this could represent an advantage in some situations.","Work in medium-sized groups require students to be particularly open and respectful towards each other contribution, otherwise some members may prevail on their peers and interdependence could be endangered. Asking a student to moderate the interactions might help mitigate the risk. The leading principle is that inclusion can only be achieved by educating ALL the students to participate and let others participate.",62,63,64,65,,,,,,,
Team,LARGE GROUPS,"Learner groups numbering twenty members or more.  Large groups lend themselves to tasks like presentations or debating, but are mostly unsuitable for collaborative work where the level of interdepence among members is high. ","Work in large groups require students to be particularly open and respectful towards each other contribution, otherwise some members may prevail on their peers and interdependence could be endangered. Asking a student to moderate the interactions might help mitigate the risk. The leading principle is that inclusion can only be achieved by educating ALL the students to participate and let others participate.",66,67,68,69,,,,,,,
Team,PLENARY,"The entire learner population addressed, be it a single class or a whole cohort of students. Plenaries are suitable for things like activity launches, presentations, meetings with experts and lecture sessions. ","In plenary sessions, the role of the teacher as facilitator becomes particularly important. Dealing with diversity in these contexts may be difficult, as teachers cannot give attention to all individuals. However, there are cases where it is necessary to use plenary sessions and students need to learn to respect each other in plenary, as well as in smaller groups.",70,71,72,73,,,,,,,
Team,,,,163,164,165,166,,,,,,,
Technology,FORUM,"A tool for asynchronous many-to-many communication, usually text-based. Usually forums are used to manage discussions, which may be devoted to collaborative preparation and production of documents, presentations, and the like.
Forums can be used for interaction among and within smaller or larger groups (pairs, small groups, medium-sized groups, large groups). ","Asynchronous communication requires good command of written language, but does not require that students have broadband connection and a PC at their full disposal. Thus, teachers shall choose this type of communication when some of the students do not have high-speed internet connection.The permanent nature of this communication facilitates reflection and understanding in non-native speakers, provided they can read.",28,29,30,31,,,,,,,
Technology,PRESENTATION SOFTWARE,"Applications like PowerPoint or Prezi for creating slide presentations that can be shown to a live or online audience. These applications are used to prepare presentations that will ultimately be given to an audience, as the result of individual or group work. 
Presentations can be initially prepared at individual level, and then shared with others for further editing, provided that the partners/group members agree on how to manage different versions of the original presentation. ","The use of drawings, schemes and pictures in a presentation facilitates meta-cognition (in presenters) and understanding (in the audience). A picture is worth a thousand words!",74,75,76,77,,,,,,,
Technology,INTERACTIVE WHITEBOARD (IWB),"A large digital display unit with an interactive surface that allows you to display content (text, images, videos, etc.)  from a connected computer but also to manipulate these and add notes and drawings. The Interactive Whiteboard can be used in a number of different ways, from producing and assembling digital material of different kinds to showing and interacting with that material. It can be employed in both individual and group situations.","IWBs can be a catalyst for class participation. Their size together with their multi-touch features, foster engagement.",78,79,80,81,,,,,,,
Technology,WIKI SOFTWARE,"A system for people to create and edit web pages in a collaborative manner using a web browser. Typically, wikis are collaboratively constructed webpages managed by groups (small, medium-sized or large) or entire communities.
The browser-based systems for constructing and editing wikis keep track of all the changes that contributors make and provide space for contributors to discuss any changes. The wiki owner/administrator can allow newcomers to join the contributor group.  ","Wikis are collaborative writing tools that allow interaction even in large groups. Their commenting feature is regarded as a critical tool for contributing to peers work. However, wikis require students to conceptualize clearly how to use them, thus requiring non-trivial digital skills that cannot be taken for granted.",82,172,84,85,,,,,,,
Technology,VIDEOCONFERENCING SYSTEM,"A system allowing people to meet synchronously online using audio, video and text. It supports one-to-many interactions, like online lectures or webinars, and many-to-many ones, like virtual meetings and collaborative work. In large groups, one-to-many communication is most common, but break-out rooms can be used to split the audience in smaller groups and activate many-to-many interactions. Most videoconferencing systems  include screen-sharing capabilities for online presentations (see the “Presenting work” task).","These systems can replace face-to-face communication when it is impossible. They can be used to facilitate interactions between geographically disperse students and make diverse realities meet, to include students who cannot be in the classroom (e.g. hospitalized students) or to reach out for experts far away. When the lack of broadband connection or appropriate devices hinders participation, less demanding technological choices might be advisable. ",86,87,88,89,,,,,,,
Technology,SELECTED STUDY MATERIALS,"Reference materials on a given topic that the teacher has sourced and then presents for study - may include articles, papers, books, lecture notes, website links, audio-visual materials, etc. Individual learners or groups can be assigned a set of reference materials by the teacher, typically for study. ","Different students can be given different material, appropriate to their skills, so that each student can provide their contribution to the final artifact. Digital translators can be of help to facilitate students with linguistic problems. ",90,91,92,93,,,,,,,
Technology,SOURCE OF MATERIALS FOR LEARNING,"Any general information source, like the Internet or a library, that learners access to search for data, documents and the like.  Learners might be instructed to explore the web or to browse other information sources (libraries, databases, repositories, etc.) in search of relevant material. ","When students search for learning material in a given information source, they will be able to retrieve material they see fit for their skills and purpose (including language-wise). However, teachers should check source reliability and level of difficulty. In this sense, self-regulated learning skills of the students should be appropriately cultivated.",94,95,96,97,,,,,,,
Technology,TEXT EDITOR,"An application like Word or GoogleDocs for creating and editing texts either offline or online - when used in a group, it allows members to work together on the same document, either by adding contributions or commenting on what others have written. Typically used to produce text-based documents from scratch or to edit existing documents. Learners can also use them to comment on their peers’ work. ","Word processors are more suited for individual writing tasks or for collaborative tasks that can be easily streamlined. Google docs or similar cloud based technology are more suited to work in parallel,  but  getting used to collaborative writing with these tools may require some time as it requires  a strong interdependence of the actors involved. The benefit, in these cases, is that the product  is perceived as the result of a joint effort rather than the mere sum of the effort of several individuals.",98,99,100,101,,,,,,,
Technology,PROJECTOR,"A device for projecting the video signal from a computer onto a screen, so that it can be seen by a potentially large audience. Typically used to show to presentations, demos or other digital artefacts to an audience gathered in a face-to-face session.  ","The projector allows teachers and students to make use of different communication channels while presenting a piece of work and therefore ensure that the message gets across more easily to a diversified audience. Attention should be paid to specific needs: non-native speakers take advantage from the use of written text and graphics, colour blind students or visually impaired students will need careful choice of colors and big fonts, etc. The use of the projector for students presentations should be encouraged.",102,103,104,105,,,,,,,
Technology,NO COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY,"While in online contexts communication is mediated by forums or videoconferences, in face-to-face situations communications is not mediated. The use of this card is mandatory any time you opt for face-to-face interactions. ","Communication technologies are a powerful mean for putting students in contact with diferent realities, in order to make them aware that the world is very diversified and that other cultures and people deserve respect and interest. However, when students can work side by side in their classroom, non mediated interactions are more natural, make socialization and inclusion  easier and more spontaneous. Thus, teachers shall use communication technologies only when it provides an added value. ",106,107,108,109,,,,,,,
Technology,MATERIALS AND TOOLS FOR PRACTICE,"Any tool or material the teacher makes available to learners for practical activities. These include things like maker kits, educational software, apps, simulators, but also non-digital tools, such as carboard, theater clothings for drama plays, clay or play dough, etc. <br> Tools and materials that can be used for practical activities/exercises, usually entailed in tasks like ""Carrying out an assignment"" or ""Producing an artifact"".","Working together to create something is a very bonding experience, that enhances interdependence and favours socialization. Students are usually very proud of their creations and this strenghthens self-esteem. Ownership increases if teachers let the students choose among different types of materials, or provide them with digital microworlds that allow for practicing abstract concepts and skills in a virtual environment that makes them concrete.",110,111,112,113,,,,,,,
Technology,,,,167,168,169,170,,,,,,,
Task,WRITING A TEXT,"Writing a text following a set of instructions. The text can range from a simple for-and-against list on a topic, to a full narrative. This task can be carried out individually or collaboratively, in pairs or small groups.
The text can be produced with a text editor or a wiki software and shared with others via a discussion forum or f2f (no technology). The task normally requires a minimum of a week to complete, longer if the text is complex. ","Students generally need to get used to collaborarive writing. Hence, the teacher plays an important role in regulating the process. The document aim and structure should be defined first, possibly negotiated between teacher and students, so that each contributor knows where its work should fit. It is not necessary that all students are involved in the writing, some of them may beasked to read and provide feedback. Collaborative writing adds significantly to the students' writing skills and to the text quality, but requires time to harmonisation the process and its outcome.",32,33,34,35,,,,,,,
Task,STUDYING,"Reading and studying assigned materials - text, audio or video recording, reference material, etc. This task is usually carried out individually or occasionally in pairs or small groups.
It usually entails the use of selected study materials. Time needed: minimum one week.","Different students have different preferences as to how to study. Some prefer to study individually, but many like to study together in pairs or small groups (which is a bery bonding experience). The teacher can offer them the possibility to choose the team they want to join, but care is needed to avoid strongly unbalanced teams, to minimize frustration. In any case, even when collaborative learning is the method chosen, it is important that students learn how to study, as this is a key skill to ensure that all children will be able to develop their own potential.",114,115,116,117,,,,,,,
Task,FINDING MATERIALS,"Conducting a search (free or guided) in any source of materials to locate information and documents on a given topic. This task can be carried out individually or also collaboratively - in pairs or small groups.
Learners will need access to the web or to any other source of material.
Time needed: minimum one week.","In this task, learners' freedom is of the essence. However, teachers should advise the students in their choices, to ensure they select reliable sources and identify material which is not too challenging or too easy for them. For example, students who are not native speakers may need material suitable to their linguistic skills.",118,119,120,121,,,,,,,
Task,PREPARING A LIST ,"Producing a list of questions (e.g. to interview an expert) or items. The value lays in the preparation, rather than in the outcome. The students will have to make choices concerning the list items and, possibly, their order. This task can be performed individually or in groups of any size, with a text editor. If the list is prepared collaboratively, the group will work f2f (no technology) or through a discussion forum or a videoconference.
The time needed depends on the communication mode: individual work or synchronous discussion may take a few hours, asynchronous discussion requires up to a week.","In teams, this task requires a strong interdependence and good negotiation skills. Teams should be composed of students with similar linguistic skills to safeguard equity of contributions. SImilarly, coupling shy students and extroverts ones might have some drawbacks.",122,123,124,125,,,,,,,
Task,COMMENTING ON SOMEONE ELSE’S WORK,"Providing feedback about the work of others, with suggestions about how that work might be improved. It often follows and is followed by a production task, e.g. “Writing a text”, “Producing an artefact”, “Preparing a Presentation”, because it aims to improve the product. It can be carried out individually (one-to-one feedback), in pairs or in small groups (group-to-group feedback) and can be reciprocal or cyclic. 
The feedback may be produced using a text editor or a wiki software and provided asynchronously in a forum, or synchronously in f2f settings (no technology).
This task requires a minimum of one week.","This is a tricky task inclusion-wise. In providing he feedback, some students need to learn to be diplomatic, others are not 100% honest. Some are not prepared to accept criticisms from peers. The social skills involved in this task are essntial to preserve a peaceful, friendly and collaborative atmosphere, without which inclusion cannot be be achieved.",126,127,128,129,,,,,,,
Task,PREPARING A PRESENTATION,"Preparing a presentation to inform others about a given topic. This usually leads to the task “Presenting work”. This task can be carried out individually or collaboratively in pairs, small or medium-sized groups.
It requires presentation software and discussion can be online (in a forum) or face-to-face (with no technology or IWB). It requires a minimum of one week.","To be inclusive, presentations should be carefully planned, use different communication channels so that all students can understand, accompany the audio with short texts, to facilitate non-native speakers. The task requires strong interdependence between team members, although the speaker tends feel responsible for the presentation and does most of the work. To avoid this and foster the sharing of responsibility, multi-voice presentations can be encouraged. Multi-voice presentations can be very inclusive as, during reharsals, students provide feedback to each other to improve the performance.",130,131,132,133,,,,,,,
Task,CARRYING OUT AN ASSIGNMENT,"Completing one or more exercises (drill & practice, quizzes, tests, etc) set by the teacher. <br> This task can be carried out individually, in pairs or in small groups.
The technology used depends on the type of assignment. It involves interactions, mediated by an IWB or with no technology in f2f contexts, or online mediated by a forum.
This task requires a minimum of one week.","This task is very inclusive when carried out in teams as students help each other to understand how it should be carried out. The choice between homogeneous teams (in terms of skills) as opposed to non-homogeneous ones is tricky, as in the former students collaborate more easily but may learn less from each other, while in the latter some students may work instead of the others, rather than with them. The best solutions is to have teams where students have complementary skills, although this does not necessarily mean that each student should do what they are already good at: in some cases the opposite is better.",134,135,136,137,,,,,,,
Task,PRESENTING WORK,"Giving a talk about a piece of work to others. 
This is usually preceded by a preparation task like “Preparing a presentation”, “Writing a text” or “Producing an artefact”. The talk is usually given during a plenary. 
<br> This task can be carried out either face-to-face, using a projector (with no technology) or IWB, or online via a videoconference. 
In any case, it involves a synchronous session that may last up to 4 hours.","Presenting a piece of work is ususally a very rewarding activity, that makes students proud (and defensive) about their work. If the work was a collaborative endeavour, than teachers could encourage the students to make multi-voiced presentation, so that all have their share of glory and responsibility. The use of multiple channels for the presentation makes it easier for peers to understand, so it should be encouraged.",138,139,140,141,,,,,,,
Task,SOLVING A PROBLEM,"Solving a problem set by the teacher. It is best carried out in pairs or small groups, but can also be individual or plenary work. Collaborative problem solving requires synchronous interactions (face-to-face with no technology, or via videoconference) or asynchronous ones, in a forum. The problem solution is usually written with a text editor.
The Time needed varies: a few hours in synchronous communication, longer (minimum one week) in asynchronous mode.","Performing this task in teams is very inclusive as students help each other to improve their solution. The choice between homogeneous teams (in terms of skills) and non-homogeneous ones is tricky, as in the former students collaborate more easily but may learn less from each other, while in the latter some students may work instead of the others, rather than with them. Ideally, teams should include students with complementary skills, though this does not mean that each student should do what they are already good at: in some cases the opposite is better.",142,143,144,145,,,,,,,
Task,INTERVIEWING AN EXPERT,"Posing questions to an expert to learn about a topic.This is usually preceded by the task “Preparing a list”.  <br> This Task is best carried out either in medium-sized or large groups, or in a plenary session. When performed asynchronously, the task may require a discussion forum, while synchronous interviewing may take place face-to-face with no technology or online via videoconference. The Time required varies according to the communication mode: in synchronous mode it requires a few hours, while in asynchronous mode it takes longer (minimum one week).","This is an exciting and motivating task: students like to carry it out especially if the expert is someone they respect. If the expert advocates a minority viewpoint, the students might learn to give it deserved attention. SImilarly, interviewing several experts proposing different viewpoints will make students consider different opinions.",146,147,148,149,,,,,,,
Task,ASSUMING ROLES,"Deciding who is to assume different roles/viewpoints within a fictional situation as part of a role-play. Role examples are: team coordinator, rapporteur, defeatist, optimist, bureaucrat, efficientist, technophile, technophobe, etc. <br> This Task is to be performed in small groups, ensuring that all the essential roles are covered. 
It can be carried out synchronously, in a face-to-face (no technology) or videoconferencing session, or asynchronously using an online forum. 
The Time required varies according to the communication mode: a few hours in synchronous mode, longer (minimum one week) in asynchronous mode.","This task has great potential in terms of inclusion because it fosters students' consideration of a diversity of points of view, the differences beween cultures, and the problems that others have to face.",150,151,152,153,,,,,,,
Task,PRODUCING AN ARTEFACT ,"Producing an artefact of any kind: a model, a map, a drawing, a video, a piece of software, etc. 
The artefact may be produced from scratch or be a revised version of a previous one, by the same author/s or by someone else. The activity ends when the artefact is handed in to the teacher or shared with others. <br> This Task can be carried out by learners working individually or in groups of any size.  
Artefact production may require the use of ""Materials and tools for practice"". The related interactions can take place online in a ""Forum"" or face-to-face, possibly using an IWB or no technology.  
This Task requires a minimum of one week. ","This task entails strong interdependence between team members, as each student can contribute based on their diverse skills. To favour inclusion, teams whose members have complementary skills are preferable.",154,155,156,157,,,,,,,
Task,DEBATING,"Holding an organised discussion that examines a particular question or issue, often with the aim of reaching a shared conclusion, or to highlight various aspects. <br> Debate can be carried out in groups of any size. 
The interactions may take place asynchronously in a forum or synchronously in a face-to-face (no technology) or videoconferencing session. 
The Time required varies according to the communication mode: in synchronous mode it may require a few hours, while in asynchronous mode it takes longer (minimum one week).","In this task, it is important that the teacher moderates the discussion to make sure that all students contribute to the debate and that there is respect for the invidual opinions.",158,159,160,161,,,,,,,
